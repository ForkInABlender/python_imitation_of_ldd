# python_imitation_of_ldd

# Notes on the code:

* The code was designed with chatGPT and my hand coding. It was also tested in replit.co website. The code may be a little buggy. (please create an issue tag and give information to aide in rectifying the error you're encountering)
* The code will give you the names of the imported libraries. It won't give you the full directory path to it (Sorry, man, I tried; even the computer said "TL;DR, human. I have my fork limit too")
*
